# Overlay bake — BUILD-TIME (BUG-003 / BAKE-01)
# ==============================================================================
# The runtime container runs with read_only: true rootfs (see docker-compose.yml
# x-hardened-base anchor).  A runtime `uv add --editable` cannot write into
# the baked /app/.venv — it silently fails, and BUG-003's startup check then
# refuses to boot as OSS when GEOLENS_EDITION=enterprise was set.
#
# The architecturally correct solution is to pre-bake overlays INTO the image
# at BUILD time so the read_only runtime never needs to write.
#
# BAKE-01: this block now accepts a SPACE-SEPARATED LIST of overlay dirs so
# both an enterprise and a cloud overlay can bake into one image. Each listed
# dir must already exist inside the build context (staged via COPY in a derived
# Dockerfile) and must contain a pyproject.toml — the guard fails closed
# otherwise (exit 1).
#
# These arguments are a legacy hook for distributors that vendor and modify
# this Dockerfile so their own COPY instructions occur before this RUN. They
# are not a supported derived-image interface: a child Dockerfile cannot insert
# a COPY into the middle of its parent build. Official paid distributions own
# an immutable overlay Dockerfile that starts from the completed core runtime,
# installs a locked wheel at build time, and promotes that same image to API,
# worker, and migration services.
#
# Back-compat alias: INSTALL_ENTERPRISE_OVERLAY (legacy single-overlay ARG from
# pre-BAKE-01 distributor-owned Dockerfiles). When their Dockerfile already
# stages /enterprise, the alias still prepends that path. It does not make an
# unmodified public build capable of copying a private overlay.
#
# When both ARGs are empty (the only supported public build) this block is a no-op and the OSS
# image is byte-for-byte unchanged.  CI always builds without the ARGs so the
# OSS path is exercised on every run.
#
# NOTE: overlay dirs are excluded from the OSS build context by .dockerignore
# and this Dockerfile has no overlay COPY. The guard therefore fails closed in
# an unmodified checkout. Do not advertise this hook as a paid-image build.

# Dependabot tracks Docker digest updates for this file.
# db/Dockerfile uses postgis/postgis:18-3.6 which is amd64-ONLY — this stage
# uses the digest-pinned postgres:18 base so publish.yml can build both arches
# (BKP-01).
# chore(#704): must match the db server major — pg_dump refuses to dump a
# server NEWER than itself, so this stage bumps in lockstep with db/Dockerfile.
# PostGIS is NOT needed client-side: pg_dump streams the raw catalog over the
# wire and custom-format dumps preserve PostGIS types without PostGIS libs.
#
# Placement note: this stage is intentionally NOT last. An unqualified
# `docker build .` resolves to the FINAL stage, and the default image must be an
# app image (frontend), never this postgres-based backup tool. Every image is
# built with an explicit `target:` (publish.yml + docker-compose*.yml), so stage
# order only governs that unqualified-build default — keep `backup` non-final.
